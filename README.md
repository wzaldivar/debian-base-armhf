# ⚠️ OBSOLETE - KEPT FOR HISTORY ONLY ⚠️

This image contains pre-installed ARM cross-compilation tools from [wzaldivararmhf/arm-provider](https://github.com/wzaldivar/arm-provider).

**This approach is no longer needed** - Docker now has native multi-arch support.

**What this was:** Debian base images with QEMU ARM emulation tools pre-installed  
**What you should use now:** Native Docker multi-platform builds

```
# Modern approach - no special base images needed
FROM --platform=$TARGETPLATFORM debian:latest
# Docker handles ARM compilation natively
```

**Historical usage** (if you're curious):

```
FROM wzaldivararmhf/debian-base-armhf
RUN ["cross-build-start"]
# your ARM build commands here
RUN ["cross-build-end"]
```

See [wzaldivararmhf/arm-provider](https://github.com/wzaldivar/arm-provider) for details on how the cross-compilation toolchain worked.
